fcitx5-shami is a self-made boshiamy fcitx5 input method.
Made just for self usage, and boshiamy data comes from fcitx-table-extra.
For arch users, please install fcitx5-table-extra, fcitx5-chinese-addons before running ./install.sh to install
(compile may need some time due to the super efficient-less implementation).
